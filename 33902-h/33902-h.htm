<span class="i0">Now, God be thanked Who has matched us with His hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Leave the sick hearts that honour could not move,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nothing to shake the laughing heart's long peace there<br /></span>

<span class="i1">And heard our word, 'Who is so safe as we?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have found safety with all things undying,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The deep night, and birds singing, and clouds flying,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And sleep, and freedom, and the autumnal earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have built a house that is not for Time's throwing.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Desire illimitable, and still content,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all dear names men use, to cheat despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the perplexed and viewless streams that bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our hearts at random down the dark of life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, ere the unthinking silence on that strife<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My night shall be remembered for a star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That outshone all the suns of all men's days.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I not crown them with immortal praise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom I have loved, who have given me, dared with me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High secrets, and in darkness knelt to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The inenarrable godhead of delight?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of friendly bread; and many-tasting food;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rainbows; and the blue bitter smoke of wood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flowers themselves, that sway through sunny hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, the cool kindliness of sheets, that soon<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Shining and free; blue-massing clouds; the keen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unpassioned beauty of a great machine;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Firm sands; the little dulling edge of foam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That browns and dwindles as the wave goes home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And washen stones, gay for an hour; the cold<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And give what's left of love again, and make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New friends, now strangers....<br /></span>
<span class="i14">But the best I've known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stays here, and changes, breaks, grows old, is blown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the winds of the world, and fades from brains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of living men, and dies.<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Nothing remains.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Out of the gold air of the afternoon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One knelt before her: hair he had, or fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound back above his ears with golden wire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Baring the eager marble of his face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not man's nor woman's was the immortal grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rounding the limbs beneath that robe of white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lighting the proud eyes with changeless light,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The day that <i>Youth</i> had died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came to his grave-side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In decent mourning, from the county's ends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those scatter'd friends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had lived the boon companions of his prime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laughed with him and sung with him and wasted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In feast and wine and many-crown'd carouse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The days and nights and dawnings of the time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When <i>Youth</i> kept open house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor left untasted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aught of his high emprise and ventures dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No quest of his unshar'd&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All these, with loitering feet and sad head bar'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Followed their old friend's bier.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Folly</i> went first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With muffled bells and coxcomb still revers'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after trod the bearers, hat in hand&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Laughter</i>, most hoarse, and Captain <i>Pride</i> with tanned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And martial face all grim, and fussy <i>Joy</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who had to catch a train, and <i>Lust</i>, poor, snivelling boy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These bore the dear departed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind them, broken-hearted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came <i>Grief</i>, so noisy a widow, that all said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Had he but wed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her elder sister <i>Sorrow</i>, in her stead!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by her, trying to soothe her all the time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fatherless children, <i>Colour</i>, <i>Tune</i>, and <i>Rhyme</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The sweet lad <i>Rhyme</i>), ran all-uncomprehending.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, at the way's sad ending,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span><span class="i0">Round the raw grave they stay'd. Old <i>Wisdom</i> read,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In mumbling tone, the Service for the Dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There stood <i>Romance</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The furrowing tears had mark'd her roug&egrave;d cheek;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor old <i>Conceit</i>, his wonder unassuaged;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dead <i>Innocency's</i> daughter, <i>Ignorance</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shabby, ill-dress'd <i>Generosity</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>Argument</i>, too full of woe to speak;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Passion</i>, grown portly, something middle-aged;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>Friendship</i>&mdash;not a minute older, she;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Impatience</i>, ever taking out his watch;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Faith</i>, who was deaf, and had to lean, to catch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old <i>Wisdom's</i> endless drone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Beauty</i> was there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale in her black; dry-eyed; she stood alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor maz'd <i>Imagination</i>; <i>Fancy</i> wild;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ardour</i>, the sunlight on his greying hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Contentment</i>, who had known <i>Youth</i> as a child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never seen him since. And <i>Spring</i> came too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dancing over the tombs, and brought him flowers&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She did not stay for long.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>Truth</i>, and <i>Grace</i>, and all the merry crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The laughing <i>Winds</i> and <i>Rivers</i>, and lithe <i>Hours</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>Hope</i>, the dewy-eyed; and sorrowing <i>Song</i>;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, with much woe and mourning general,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At dead <i>Youth's</i> funeral,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even these were met once more together, all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who erst the fair and living <i>Youth</i> did know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All, except only <i>Love</i>. <i>Love</i> had died long ago.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Until the centuries blend and blur<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Grantchester, in Grantchester....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still in the dawnlit waters cool<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A hundred Vicars down the lawn;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On lissom, clerical, printless toe;<br /></span>
